## Incorrect SMA Energy data

At least one time, the data in Home Assistant for SMA Inverter and Home Manager 2.0 has been wrong.\
In this case, there was a peak at 25/1-2022 where produced (consumed) solar was over 2700 kWh early in the morning.\
Others have also had this problem, see [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sma-solar-sensor-pv-gen-meter-showing-inconsistent-data/368280) and [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/61838).

Note that history graph for `sensor.total_yield` and `sensor.pv_gen_meter` still has a dip to zero in history graph even after correcting the data according to below, possibly related to data not being present in the `states` table (see below).

### This is how I identified and corrected the problem.

#### For Recorder database (MariaDB) i am using MySQL Workbench and excel to correct:

Note that one only has 5 minute window to correct, otherwise `statistics_short_term` table will have new data to correct (and if over each hour, `statistics` table.

Be extra cautious with the sql-update commands, preferably take a backup before updating.

1. Identify the different meta-id that you need to look at through `select * from homeassistant.statistics_meta`.
   - You may need to identify several that applies to the error.
   - The problem was identified to occur from roughly 2022-01-24 19:00 to roughly 2022-01-25 06:00.
   - For this problem the following sensor-data was identified to investigate (all have the unit kWh):
     - metadata_id 4: `sensor.total_yield`.
     - metadata_id 5: `sensor.pv_gen_meter`.
     - metadata_id 8: `sensor.metering_total_yield`.
     - metadata_id 9: `sensor.metering_total_absorbed`.
     - metadata_if 17: `sensor.metering_total_yield_compensation`.
   - Sensor data for these, resides in the following statistics-tables:
     - `statistics` for hourly data.
     - `statistics_short_term` for 5 minute data.
2. For the identified meta-ids, run sql command to look at the statistics data:
   - With:
     - `select * from homeassistant.TABLE where metadata_id = METADATA_ID order by created desc;`.
   - For this problem, it occured when `state` was set to 0 (zero).
3. First we need to correct where `state` is 0 (zero) for identified statistics-tables and metadata_ids.
   - Do this by updating `state` column to the last valid value (data is not updating during the period).
4. Then we need to correct `sum` column so it is correctly reflects the increase for the statistics-tables.
   - Do this by updating the `sum` column from the where it is clear that the sum-increase is wrong.
5. Remember to verify that no new values has been written to the tables.
   - If so, they need to be updated.
6. For the `states` table We there was usually no data saved when the error occured (or 'unknown'/'unavailable' was written), but the following sensors needed correction (we corrected these, even though they will be removed when purge-period comes):
   - `sensor.total_yield` - One state_id was wrong.
   - `sensor.pv_gen_meter` - One state_id was wrong.
   - `sensor.metering_total_yield` - One state_id was wrong.
   - `sensor.metering_total_absorbed` has correct inserts for the timespan.
   - `sensor.metering_total_yield_compensation` - One state_id was wrong.
 
To update both `state` and `sum` column, I copied the data into a excel-matrix and made sql-commands based on the data, such as `update homeassistant.statistics_short_term set sum = 604.883 where id = 33890;` and `update homeassistant.states set state = 2756.716 where state_id = 1289802;`.
I did not utilize the python program suggested in above links.

#### For the InfluxDB history database, the following was performed:

Since the data in the `states` table is wrong, we can assume that the data is also wrong in the InfluxDB database as states are pushed here.

We cannot correct the data in InfluxDB directly through commands due to the design of the time-series database, instead we import corrected data so the data is overwritten.

Be extra cautious with the delete command, preferably take a backup before updating.

1. Logon to InfluxDB databas and run the following in `Data Explorer` (Table view) for the above identified sensors and the valid time-ranges, according to:
```
from(bucket: "ha")
  |> range(start: 2022-01-24T00:00:00Z, stop: 2022-01-26T12:00:00Z)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["entity_id"] == "total_yield")
```
2. Export each sensor to csv.
3. In excel, isolate if there are wrong data during the timespan.
   - In my case, `_value` was 0 (zero) for `_time` 2022-01-25T00:42:43.152029Z for `total_yield`.
   - And similar for the following entity_ids:
     - `pv_gen_meter`.
     - `metering_total_yield`.
     - `metering_total_yield_compensation`.
5. Go to the InfluxDB container on server1:
   - `sudo docker-compose exec ha-history-db bash`.
     - With shell in the container, delete the spefic _time (I did not manage to overwrite data with export/import-csv):
       - Note that you need to be precise with the timestamp, as we do not use '--predicate', and would otherwise delete extensive amount of data.
         ```
         influx delete -b ha --start '2022-01-25T00:42:43.152029Z' --stop '2022-01-25T00:42:43.152029Z'
         ```
         - No error/output should occur.
    - Iterate through all above sensors and correct where necessary.
